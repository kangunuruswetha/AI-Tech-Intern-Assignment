### Features Implemented

The To-Do Manager is designed with a full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow and a bonus AI feature:

* **Create (Add):** Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
* **Read (View):** All tasks are displayed in a list format on the page.
* **Update (Edit):**
    * Clicking the pencil icon allows users to edit a task's text.
    * Clicking on the task text itself toggles its completion status, visually marking it as done with a strikethrough.
* **Delete (Remove):** The trash can icon allows users to delete a task from the list.
* **Bonus AI Feature:** Clicking the "Generate a new task" button uses an AI-powered function to automatically suggest and add a new, random task to the list. This demonstrates a simple integration of AI to enhance the application's functionality.
